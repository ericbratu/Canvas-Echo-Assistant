As of August 2021, students are no longer able to link their Canvas profile to their Amazon Echo to ask their Echo questions regarding their Canvas schedule. 

Therefore, I created an Echo "skill" that students can utilize to ask their Echo certain questions regarding their Canvas!

## Setup

Before we do anything, use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) in your CMD prompt

```bash
pip install requests
```

All the files you need for this setup can be found at my [Github repo](https://github.com/ericbratu/AmazonEchoCanvasReader)

To avoid making this readme super lengthy, I recorded a video tutorial you can watch [here]() that has all the rest of the steps you need to set this up!

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
