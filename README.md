As of August 2021, students are no longer able to link their Canvas profile to their Amazon Echo to ask their Echo questions regarding their Canvas schedule. 

Therefore, I created this Echo "skill" that students can utilize to ask their Echo certain questions regarding their Canvas!

This is an **UNOFFICIAL** Canvas Skill, meaning I am in no way affiliated with Canvas or any Instructure affiliated projects. I made this simply just for myself and figured I'd put it out there for others to use if they'd like.

## Setup

Before we do anything, use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) in your CMD prompt

```bash
pip install requests
```


To avoid making this readme super lengthy, I recorded a video tutorial you can watch [here]() that has all the rest of the steps you need to set this up!

## Usage

**To use your skill in the Alexa app:**

1. Sign in to the Alexa app with the same credentials as your developer account.

2. To find your skill in the Alexa app, tap More, and then tap Skills & Games.

3. In Skills & Games, tap Your Skills.

4. Scroll the skill types to the right, and then tap Dev.

5. Scroll to find your skill.

6. Tap on your skill name, and then tap ENABLE TO USE.

7. If your skill uses account linking, follow the prompts to enter your credentials for your cloud account. To allow access to the skill, tap Allow, and then tap CLOSE.

**To use your skill on your Alexa Device:**

1. Register the device with the same email address that you used to sign up for your developer account on the Amazon developer portal. Make sure that the locale of your device matches at least one of the locales available for your skill.

2. Then, you can invoke the skill with the wake word and your invocation name: "Alexa, open Unofficial Canvas."
